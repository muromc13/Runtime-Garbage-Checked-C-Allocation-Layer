Welcome to the **Runtime Garbage Checked C Allocation Layer** repository! This project offers a powerful tool to enhance memory management in C programs. It uses the `LD_PRELOAD` method to interpose and wrap all `malloc`-family calls. By embedding canary-guarded headers, it effectively catches double frees and buffer overflows. Additionally, it provides leak reporting at exit while ensuring thread and fork safety.

## Features

- **Memory Management**: Efficiently manage memory allocations and deallocations.
- **Double-Free Detection**: Identify and prevent double-free errors.
- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Guard against buffer overflows with canary values.
- **Leak Reporting**: Automatically report memory leaks upon program exit.
- **Thread and Fork Safety**: Ensure safe operation in multi-threaded and forked environments.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muromc13/Runtime-Garbage-Checked-C-Allocation-Layer.git
cd Runtime-Garbage-Checked-C-Allocation-Layer
```

Next, build the project:

```bash
make
```

You can now set the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to use the interposer:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=./libmalloc_wrapper.so
```

## Usage

To use the Runtime Garbage Checked C Allocation Layer, simply run your C program with the `LD_PRELOAD` variable set. For example:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=./libmalloc_wrapper.so ./your_program
```

This setup will ensure that all memory allocations in `your_program` will be monitored for errors.

## Topics

This project covers several important topics in memory management:

- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Safeguards against unauthorized access to memory.
- **C**: The programming language this tool is built for.
- **Double-Free Detection**: Helps catch errors that can lead to crashes.
- **Fork-Safe**: Ensures safe operation in forked processes.
- **Heap Sanitizer**: Assists in identifying heap-related issues.
- **LD_PRELOAD**: A powerful method to interpose library calls.
- **Malloc Wrapper**: A wrapper around standard memory allocation functions.
- **Memory Leak**: Detects memory that is allocated but never freed.
- **Memory Management**: The overall practice of handling memory allocation and deallocation.
